# JIE-Typst-Template
An UNOFFICIAL [Typst](https://typst.app/) template for Journal of Industrial Ecology submissions. **Not authorised by JIE** but follows the Word template.

## Instructions for use
- Copy the files to your own device or folder.
- Replace the arguments by the relevant information. Keep them in the correct format (i.e. in content blocks `[]` for most, arrays of content blocks `()` for some).
- To see a mock-up of the submission in article format change the `show-as-article` variable to `true`.

## Fonts
This template uses three fonts (one for the submission style, two for the article style) that are included in the Typst web app. These can also be downloaded for free.

2. [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) for the article style main text and headers.
